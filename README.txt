CGA-demonstrator CGA HAW WS22/23


This repository contains the THREE.js demonstrator created for the course CGA.
To run the project start a lokal server and open the Index.html in Google Chrome.


Functionalities:
There are two windmill-objects in the scene, both with interactive panels.
On each panel are three buttons:
If you press the first button the windmill starts spinning and making sounds
If you press the second button, while the first one is also active, the windmill spins faster
If you press the third button, while the first one is active, the sound gets louder

You can shoot balls with spacebar to test the physics of the objects in the scene
